# Enrollment Station using YubiKey Smart Cards

A Smart Card enrollment station for use in enterprises with Microsoft Active Directory Certificate Services and certificate-based logons. This software package will streamline some operations such as enrolling and terminating Smart Card devices.

This project is an entry in the YubiKing competition and should be considered a work in progress.

### Dependencies
* Windows PKI (Active Directory Certificate Services)
* Enrollment Agent Certificate (see prerequisites)
* CCID smart cards from Yubico (currently Premium NEO and Premium NEO-N)
* (optional) YubiHSM

## Prerequisites
To use this tool you will need an Enrollment Agent Certificate which allows you to enroll certificates on behalf of other users. This certificate template is available on a default Active Directory Certificate Services (Windows CA) installation, but is normally not permitted for any users other than Domain Admins. For added security, create a dedicated user which is used as the enrollment station user.

**A. Setup Enrollment Agent certificate template permissions**
1. Log on to your Windows Certificate Authority
2. Open the Certificate Authority control panel
3. Right click the `Certificate Templates` folder and chose `Manage`
4. Find the `Enrollment Agent` template, right click on it and chose `Properties`
5. In the security tab, allow your enrollment station user to enroll the certificate.

After a while, the template should be available to the enrollment station user through the Certificates snap-in in MMC.

**B. Enroll the Enrollment Agent certificate**
1. Log on to your enrollment station as your enrollment user and open MMC.
2. In MMC, add the Certificates snap-in for the current user, and expand the Personal folder.
3. Right click on the Certificates folder and chose `Request new Certificate`. Follow the wizard, and select the `Enrollment Agent` template when asked for template.

After setting up the Enrollment Agent certificate, you need a YubiKey set to CCID Smart Card mode.

**C. Changing YubiKey to CCID Smart Card mode**
1. Download YubiKey YubiKey Manager from here https://developers.yubico.com/yubikey-manager/
2. In the GUI application (ykman-gui.exe) under `Interfaces` select on the left USB section `PIV`
3. Save the new settings with click on `Save Interfaces`

Alternativ use the CLI application (ykman.exe) and enter `ykman mode CCID`

### First-run
Run `Discover-EnrollmentAgent.ps1` to locate the thumbprint of the local Enrollment Agent certificate. The script will store the results in enrollmentagent.txt which will be read by the other scripts.

Run `Generate-ManagementKey.ps1` to generate a 24 byte management key. The results are stored in `ManagementKey.bin` for use on all future YubiKeys. For added security, make sure nobody but the enrollment station user can read the file.

## Operations

### Enrolling a user 
Run `Enroll-NewYubikey.ps1` and follow the wizard. You will need to specify which user to enroll on behalf of, as well as set up a secure PIN and PUK code for the YubiKey.

### Termination of a Yubikey
To terminate a YubiKey, insert it into the enrollment station and run the `Terminate-Yubikey.ps1`. It will do the following: 
* Reset the Yubikey, thus removing the data stored on it
* Revoke the certificate enrolled on the Yubikey (using data from the log created during enrollment)

If the YubiKey is lost or stolen, run `Lost-Yubikey.ps1` instead. 

### Powershell CMDlet
The `SharedFeatures.ps1` file contains common functionality used by the other scripts. Many commands also take a `ManagementKey` parameter, which always has a default value of `010203040506070801020304050607080102030405060708`. If the Management Key on the Yubikey is not this default value, it should be speciefied when calling the cmdlets.

The commands are:

* `Generate-RandomString` generates a printable string - optionally using YubiHSM
    
      PS > Generate-RandomString -Length 12 -UseYubicoHsm $true
      hByJ4KzbhkkH

* `Generate-RandomStringHex` generates a HEX string - optionally using YubiHSM
    
      PS > Generate-RandomStringHex -LengthBytes 12 -UseYubicoHsm $true
      E7FBBF99B9C0A52E82ABEFD9

* `Yubico-ResetDevice` resets a Yubikey by performing a block and then calling `reset`

      PS > Yubico-ResetDevice
      Pin verification failed, 2 tries left before pin is blocked.
      Pin verification failed, 1 tries left before pin is blocked.
      Pin code blocked, use unblock-pin action to unblock.
      Pin code blocked, use unblock-pin action to unblock.
      Failed verifying puk code, now 2 tries left before blocked.
      Failed verifying puk code, now 1 tries left before blocked.
      The puk code is blocked, you will have to reinitialize the applet.
      The puk code is blocked, you will have to reinitialize the applet.
      Successfully reset the applet.

* `Yubico-SetManagementKey` sets a Yubikeys Mangement Key to a specified value. Accepts an `OldManagementKey` parameter.
 
      PS > Yubico-SetManagementKey -NewManagementKey A4CE0A0BF0716B8739E1B8AB621F8F6047C5C65F32D0A0CF
      Successfully set new management key.

* `Yubico-SetPin` sets a new Pin code on the Yubikey. If the current Pin is not the default `123456` it has to be specified using the `OldPin` parameter.

      PS > Yubico-SetPin -NewPin 87654321
      Successfully changed the pin code.

* `Yubico-SetPuk` same as `SetPin`, just for Puk codes.

      PS > Yubico-SetPuk -NewPuk 876543
      Successfully changed the puk code.

* `Yubico-SetTriesCount` changes the Pin and Puk tries from 3 to the specified values. Accepts an `ManagementKey` parameter.

      PS > Yubico-SetTriesCount -PukTries 8 -PinTries 2

* `Yubico-SetCHUID` updates the Yubikeys CHUID value. This makes the Yubikey appear as a new device in Windows operating systems. Accepts an `ManagementKey` parameter.

      PS > Yubico-SetCHUID
      Successfully set new CHUID.

* `Yubico-GenerateKey` generates a new private/public key-pair using the Yubikey. The public key is written to the file in the `OutputFile` parameter. Accepts an `ManagementKey` parameter.

      PS > Yubico-GenerateKey -OutputFile out.pem
      Successfully generated a new private key.

* `Yubico-GenerateCSR` generates a new CSR based on a previously generated public key and outputs a new certificate request

      PS > Yubico-GenerateCSR -PublicKey out.pem -RequestFile request.csr
      Successfully verified PIN.
      Successfully generated a certificate request.

* `Yubico-Importcert` imports a signed certificate onto the Yubikey to complete an enrollment. Accepts an `ManagementKey` parameter.

      PS > Yubico-Importcert -CertificateFile .\out.crt
      Successfully imported a new certificate.

* `Yubico-GetDeviceId` prints out the device id. Requires that only one Yubikey is present, else it will fail.

      PS > Yubico-GetDeviceId
      1c41e8

* `Sign-OnBehalfOf` signs a certificate request on behalf of another user. Requires a thumbprint of an `Enrollment Agent` certificate which is available to the currently signed on user. The `User` parameter specifies which AD user to perform this enrollment for. This command will show a dialog to chose the CA to use.

      PS > Sign-OnBehalfOf -EnrollmentAgentCert 07C3F21783B06583974C14A2AE89C1EABED4954E -RequestFile .\request.csr -CertificateFile out.crt -User LAB\Mike

* `Revoke-Certificate` revokes a specific certificate based on its `Serial Number`. This command will show a dialog to chose the CA to use.

      PS > Revoke-Certificate -SerialNumber 18137ea00002000001bb

* `Export-Store` exports the store.json database to the CSV format.

      PS > Export-Store

Import the functionality by opening PowerShell in the folder with the `SharedFeatures.ps1` file and write `. .\SharedFeatures.ps1`
Now you can call `Generate-RandomString` and it will output a 12 characters random string.

## Todo
* Improve YubiHSM handling (remember choices, fail if missing and previously used)
* Handle more diverse PKI setups (possibly store a favourite CA in an options)
* Add more interactive texts to advise the user when its safe to remove a Yubikey
* Store some strings encrypted (e.g. Management Key)
* Verify data from AD (e.g. specified usernames to enroll on behalf of)
* Describe revoke procedure and requirements thereto (permissions, COM object .. )
